## Footnotes

- This list prioritizes tools where **AI agents autonomously execute** GTM tasks (prospecting, writing, personalizing, booking, forecasting) — not tools that are merely "AI-enhanced" dashboards.
- Broad AI/ML frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex, etc.) are excluded unless they have a direct, purpose-built GTM application.
- Commercial tools are listed alongside open-source alternatives so teams of any size can find what works for them.
