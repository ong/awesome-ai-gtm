# Awesome AI GTM [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of AI-powered Go-To-Market tools where agents and AI do the actual work of sales, marketing, and revenue generation — not just assist.

This list focuses on tools where AI agents autonomously prospect, write outreach, personalize websites, qualify leads, forecast revenue, and close deals. Legacy CRM, marketing automation, and data platforms that simply added "AI" branding are excluded. So are broad AI/ML frameworks unless they have direct GTM applications.

## Footnotes

- This list prioritizes tools where **AI agents autonomously execute** GTM tasks (prospecting, writing, personalizing, booking, forecasting) — not tools that are merely "AI-enhanced" dashboards.
- Legacy CRM, marketing automation, sales engagement, and B2B data platforms that bolted on "AI" features are intentionally excluded. This list is for AI-native tools.
- Broad AI/ML frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex, etc.) are excluded unless they have a direct, purpose-built GTM application.
- Commercial tools are listed alongside open-source alternatives so teams of any size can find what works for them.
